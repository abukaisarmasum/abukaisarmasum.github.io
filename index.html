      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
    Abu Kaisar Mohammad Masum is a Ph.D. student in Quantum Machine Learning and Emerging Computing at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University, Bangladesh. He has authored multiple research papers in premier conferences, including DAC, DATE, ISLPED, ISCAS, QCE, ICCD, GLSVLSI, MWSCAS, AAAI Symposium (QIML), IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL), and ARQTEC @HPCA. In 2025, Abu was selected as a DAC Young Fellow, and his work was recognized with paper acceptances at DAC 2025 and poster acceptances at IEEE VIS 2024. He serves as a Session Chair for ICMLA 2024, has been a Program Committee Member for ICMLA since 2023, and was recently selected to serve on the Scientific Committee for LREC 2026. Most recently, Abu was a Winner of the NASA Beyond the Algorithm Challenge: Novel Computing Architectures for Flood Analysis, securing a $100K grant with his team for pioneering work that combines Quantum Computing and Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) for real-world flood analysis. His academic achievements have been recognized through numerous awards, including the Academic Excellence Award and the Leaf Award at ULL (2025), the Outstanding Student of the Year (2023), and Peer Tutoring Excellence Awards (Fall 2023 & Spring 2024) at FIT. He was also honored with the Best Performing Faculty and Best Researcher Awards from Daffodil International University in 2021. Abu has secured several prestigious scholarships and travel grants, including full funding to attend the Quantum Ideas Summer School 2024 at Duke University, support to participate in the TigerAI Bootcamp at LSU, and travel grants from IEEE CEDA (2025), IEEE Computer Society (2025), and AAAI, alongside graduate assistantships at both ULL and FIT. Beyond his academic pursuits, Abu remains active in the research community as a member of IEEE, IEEE CASS, IEEE CEDA, and the IEEE Quantum Technical Community. He has delivered invited talks, including at the Ingenii Global Meetup 2023, and continues to expand his expertise through certifications such as the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, AWS Academy Data Engineering, and the AI & ML Security Bootcamp at LSU/IBM.
